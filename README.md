# coding challenge

Write a web API that returns quotes in JSON format.
```
GET /quotes/<id>
GET /quotes/random
POST /quotes
```
The result of the GET requests should look like this.
```json
{
  "name": "Dean Pelton",
  "quote": "From now on, April 1st is now March 32nd."
}
```

You can use your favourite tools.

It's ok if you don't make it in time. We want to get a general idea on _how_ you work and approach problems.

If you don't feel confident enough with backend, you can also write a web page that uses this api.
