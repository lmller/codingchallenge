## Write a web API that for quotes

Create a web application using **Spring Boot** that allows the creation and fetching of quotes.

### Acceptence Criteria

- A quote consists of an author (the person who said it) and the quote itself. 
- I can create a quote using a REST Api 
- I can get all quotes via the REST Api
- I can get a filtered list of quote containing all quotes from a specific author
- The API is secured using Basic Authentication
- There are two users: One who is only allowed to read quotes and another one who can also create them. 

### Other Requirements

- Created quotes should be persisted to a relational database, but don't have to survive a restart of the server.
